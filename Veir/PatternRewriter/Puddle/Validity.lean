# Puddle Patterns Validity

This file defines the obligations for a Puddle pattern to be considered valid (`Pattern.Valid`),
both structurally and semantically. If `Pattern.Valid` holds, then compiling the Puddle pattern to
with `Pattern.compile` should produce a rewrite pattern that satisfies `LocalRewritePattern.Valid`.

## Supported Opcodes

Puddle currently supports operations that cannot terminate a block and have no memory effects.
-/

/--
An opcode is supported when it is not a terminator and has no memory effects for any possible
property value.

We could in the future support opcodes when we know that the properties matched or created by the
pattern are such that the operation has no memory effects, but this is only happening in rare cases.
-/
def SupportedOpCode (opCode : OpInfo) : Prop :=
  HasOpInfo.isTerminator opCode = false ∧
    ∀ property, HasOpInfo.getEffects opCode property = .none

/-- A match declaration is supported when the opcode of an operation declaration is supported. -/
@[expose]
def MatchDecl.Supported (decl : MatchDecl OpInfo) : Prop :=
  match decl with
  | .operation opCode _ _ _ _ _ _ _ => SupportedOpCode opCode
  | _ => True

/-- Every declaration in a match program uses supported opcodes. -/
@[expose]
def MatchProg.Supported (prog : MatchProg OpInfo α) : Prop :=
  (∀ decl ∈ prog.decls, decl.Supported)

/-- A creation declaration is supported when the opcode of an operation declaration is supported. -/
@[expose]
def CreateDecl.Supported : CreateDecl OpInfo → Prop
  | .operation opCode _ _ _ _ _ => SupportedOpCode opCode
  | _ => True

/-- Every declaration in a creation program uses supported opcodes. -/
@[expose]
def CreateProg.Supported (prog : CreateProg OpInfo α) : Prop :=
  ∀ decl ∈ prog.decls, decl.Supported

/-- The pattern only references supported opcodes. -/
@[expose]
def Pattern.Supported (rule : Pattern OpInfo) : Prop :=
  rule.matcher.Supported ∧ rule.creation.Supported

/-! ## Root Constraint -/

/--
The first declaration in the match program is an operation declaration whose operation handle is
the program's distinguished root handle.
-/
def MatchProg.ConstrainsRoot (prog : MatchProg OpInfo α) : Prop :=
  match prog.decls with
  | .operation _ _ _ _ _ opHandle _ _ :: _ => opHandle = prog.rootHandle
  | _ => False

## Pattern Validity

`Pattern.Valid` is the predicate that a Puddle pattern is both sound structurally and
semantically.  If `Pattern.Valid` holds, then compiling the Puddle pattern to
with `Pattern.compile` should produce a rewrite pattern that satisfies `LocalRewritePattern.Valid`.
-/

/-- The static validity conditions required by a Puddle pattern. -/
structure Pattern.Valid (rule : Pattern OpInfo) : Prop where
  /-- Every operation declaration in the pattern uses a supported opcode. -/
  Supported : rule.Supported
  /-- The match program starts with an operation declaration constraining its root handle. -/
  ConstrainsRoot : rule.matcher.ConstrainsRoot
