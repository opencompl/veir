  Correctness proofs for the LLVM-dialect combines in `Combine.lean`.

  `Proofs.lean` covers the combines that rewrite already-selected `riscv` ops; those are
  exact equalities over the total `Data.RISCV.Reg` type. The combines proven here instead
  rewrite `llvm` ops, whose semantics carry poison, so the obligation is a *refinement*
  `source ⊒ target` rather than an equality: the rewritten value may be more defined than
  the original (`poison ⊒ v` for every `v`), but never less.

  Every theorem is named after the combine it justifies and is discharged by
  `veir_bv_decide`. Since `bv_decide` bitblasts, it needs concrete bitwidths; these
  theorems are therefore the `i64` instantiation of combines that are stated generically
  in `Combine.lean`. Width-changing combines use the `i32`/`i64` pair (`sext`/`zext` from
  `i32` to `i64`, `trunc` from `i64` to `i32`), and `i1` for `select` conditions and
  `icmp` results.

  ## Flag threading

  A combine may freely *drop* a flag from an op it rewrites — that only removes poison —
  but it must not *transplant* one onto a created op whose poison condition differs.
  Eighteen of these combines originally did the latter, with an integer-overflow flag
  (`nsw`/`nuw`), an `exact` flag, a `zext`'s `nneg`, or an `or`'s `disjoint`; they have
  since been fixed in `Combine.lean` to clear the offending flag on the op they create.

  The theorems below are stated against the fixed rewrites, so the created op carries a
  literal `false` exactly where `Combine.lean` clears a flag, while every flag read off a
  *matched* op stays a free variable. Each such docstring records the counterexample that
  motivated the clear, so this file doubles as the justification for the flag drops.

  `(cast X) op (cast Y) → cast (X op Y)`, and the shift/`and` analogues. The rewrite keeps
  the *second* matched inner op's properties on the op it creates and discards the first
  one's, which is why the flag-carrying variants below need care.

/-- `(sext X) & (sext Y) → sext (X & Y)`. `sext` carries no flags and is injective on bit
    positions, so this holds unconditionally. -/

    Keeping `Y`'s `nneg` would be unsound: take `X = -1`, `Y = 0`, `nneg` on `Y`'s `zext`
    only. The source is `0xffffffff` (neither `zext` is poison, since only `Y`'s carries
    `nneg` and `Y ≥ 0`), but `X | Y = -1` has its msb set, so a `zext nneg` of it would be

    Keeping `nsw` would be unsound: `X = 2^31`, `Y = -1`. `trunc nsw Y` is fine (`Y`

    because of `X` alone, poisoning the created `trunc` while the source is fine.

  `0 op X → 0` for `op ∈ {shl, lshr, ashr, mul}`. The source is `0` for every `X` (and, for the

  or poison and `poison ⊒ 0`, the refinement holds *width-generically* — no bitwidth guard is
  needed. Each is discharged directly from `isRefinedBy_iff` (the constant target is never poison,
  so only the never-poison value equality `0 op X = 0` remains). The shift flags (`nsw`/`nuw`,
  `exact`) only add poison to the source, so they stay free variables. -/

/-! ### narrow_binop :  `trunc (binop X C) → binop (trunc X) (trunc C)`

  Pushing an `i64 → i32` truncation onto both operands of an add/sub/mul is bit-for-bit correct on
  the low 32 bits (add/sub/mul only propagate carries *upward*). The created operand `trunc`s and
  the narrowed binop clear all overflow flags: the source keeps the outer trunc's `s`/`u` and the
  matched binop's `nsw`/`nuw` as free variables, all of which only *add* poison, so the refinement
  holds regardless. Reusing those flags on the created ops would be unsound — e.g. `X = 2^40`,
  `C = -2^40`: `trunc nuw (X + C)` is fine (`X + C = 0`) but `trunc nuw X` is poison. -/

    `zext x` — whose operand `x` can be negative — would add poison: take `x = -1 : i8` with the
    inner `zext` non-`nneg` and the outer `zext` `nneg`. The source is `0xff` (a value), but
    `zext nneg` of `x = -1` is poison. So the created `zext` carries `false`. -/
