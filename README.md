# Verified Intermediate Representation

VeIR is a compiler infrastructure written in Lean that offers both an
[MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)-style imperative design and
(optional) ITP-level verification.
VeIR connects with MLIR via the MLIR textual format, making it
easy to combine MLIR and VeIR tooling.

## Testing

Our testing framework is split into two parts: unit tests written in Lean and
[FileCheck](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) tests for the
command line tool `veir-opt`.

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
lake test
```

### FileCheck Tests

FileCheck tests require [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to be installed.

First, install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then run the tests:

```bash
uv run lit Test/ -v
```

## Running the benchmarks

```bash
lake exe run-benchmarks add-fold-worklist
```

## From C to VeIR

This section gives an example showing how to run code through a VeIR
pass, starting from C code.

Prerequisite: An up-to-date MLIR bin directory in your PATH.

Start with a C function:
```bash
cat << _end_ > demorgan.c
unsigned d1(unsigned p, unsigned q) {
  return ~(~p & ~q);
}

unsigned short d2(unsigned short p, unsigned short q) {
  return ~(~p | ~q);
}
_end_
```

Compile to LLVM IR:
```bash
clang -cc1 -O0 -disable-O0-optnone -emit-llvm demorgan.c
```

Optimize it a little:
```bash
opt -passes=sroa demorgan.ll -S -o demorgan-opt.ll
```

Translate to MLIR:
```bash
mlir-translate --import-llvm demorgan-opt.ll | mlir-opt --mlir-print-op-generic --mlir-print-local-scope > demorgan-opt.mlir
```

Optimize using VeIR's InstCombine and DCE (dead code elimination) passes:
```bash
lake exec veir-opt -p=instcombine,dce demorgan-opt.mlir
```
